# Bored
My first attempt on an android app! It uses BoredAPI. This was made as a final project for CS50.

### General Overview of the Features
1. Generate completely random activity suggestions.
2. Set a constraint to the type/category of activities you want to be suggested.
3. Mark an acivity as favourite and access it later in the favourites tab.
4. You can even swipe to delete the favourites.


### How does it work?

The app sends api requests to [BoredAPI](www.boredapi.com).
Depending on the url that I send, it gives me back an appropriate data which I then display on my app.


### Downloading the app

There should be a file in root called `Bored.apk`. Feel free to download the apk and install it on your device to test it.
Also feel free to fork the repo and import it to your own android studio if you wanna tweak around in it.
